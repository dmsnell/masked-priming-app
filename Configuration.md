The app should be configurable from a single human-readable text-file. This document is not final and is currently serving as the scratch pad for developing the configuration interface.

## Declarative Properties

Certain pieces of the app are static and directly map to nothing more than data. Things such as the actual cards displayed on screen are some of these things because they remain the same regardless of what operational activity occurs.

## Operational Properties

The flow of the cards can be programmatically controlled, such as only displaying a certain card stack if another particular card stack had an inaccurate response.
